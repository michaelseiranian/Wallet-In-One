## Deployed System

You require at least either the Android emulator, an Android device or the iOS simulator to run the frontend mobile application on your machine.

The application has been tested on both a Pixel 6 XL Android emulation device, and an iPhone 14 Pro Max iOS simulation device.

To install the Android emulator you need to install Android Studio and then set up a device.
* https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/

You may also use an Android phone to run the mobile application.

To install the iOS simulator you need a MacOS device with Xcode installed. Windows and Linux cannot run the iOS simulator do to restrictions set by Apple.
* https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/

Once installed start up the simulator/emulator/device then navigate to the `mobile_packages` folder within the submitted deliverables' folder. Then you can drag the apk file on to the Android emulator to install, or you may install the apk onto your phone. You can drag the app file on to the iOS simulator to install.

Now you can start the app and register for an account.

There are multiple assets that can be connected to the app including Bank Accounts, Crypto Wallets, Crypto Exchanges and Stock Brokers. Below are listed some accounts to use for testing purposes. We reccomend using personal accounts where possible.
